  <h2>10 Small Repairs That Save Homeowners Money</h2>
  <p>
    Small repairs may look harmless — a loose hinge, a tiny crack in the drywall, a door that sticks
    “every now and then.” But those little problems grow quietly in the background until they turn
    into expensive surprises. Here are ten of the most common small repairs I take care of for
    homeowners in <a href="converse-tx.html">Converse, TX</a>, and why fixing them early really does save money:
  </p>

  <h3>1. Replacing Worn Caulking</h3>
  <p>
    Bathrooms and kitchens take a beating. Once caulking starts to split or pull away, water slips
    behind tile, tubs, and countertops. That’s when wood swells, drywall softens, and mold starts
    forming. A simple caulking job today often prevents a full wall replacement later.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Tightening Loose Cabinets and Hardware</h3>
  <p>
    Cabinet doors sag, knobs loosen, and drawer slides drift out of alignment over time. Most of these
    issues only need a few adjustments — tightening screws, resetting hinges, or re-anchoring hardware
    that has worked itself loose. Leaving them unfixed can strain the cabinet frames and eventually
    crack the wood. A quick tune-up keeps everything aligned and smooth.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Fixing Door Alignment Issues</h3>
  <p>
    A sticking door usually means the hinges are starting to sag. Most of the time it’s a quick fix —
    tightening hinge screws, adding longer ones into the framing, or adjusting the strike plate.
    Leaving it unfixed leads to warped trim, deeper gouges, and sometimes a full door replacement.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Repairing Small Drywall Cracks and Holes</h3>
  <p>
    A nail hole or a hairline crack doesn’t look like much, but temperature changes make these grow.
    What started as a 10-minute patch can become a long crack that needs cutting out and taping.
    Touch-ups now keep your walls looking sharp and avoid larger repairs.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Securing Loose Handrails and Grab Bars</h3>
  <p>
    If a rail or bar wiggles even slightly, it means the hardware is pulling out of the wood. That’s
    both unsafe and a sign that the anchor points are weakening. Reinforcing them early prevents
    someone from getting hurt — and avoids having to rebuild the whole railing later.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Replacing Failing Weatherstripping</h3>
  <p>
    Old, cracked weatherstripping around doors and windows lets in heat, cold, dust, and insects.
    Replacing it is inexpensive and can noticeably reduce your energy bill while improving comfort.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Lubricating or Servicing Noisy Hinges and Tracks</h3>
  <p>
    A squeaky hinge or dragging closet door track is often the first sign of metal fatigue. A little
    lubrication and tightening keeps the hardware from wearing down and saves you from replacing
    doors later on.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Fixing Loose Outlets and Switches</h3>
  <p>
    When outlets move or wiggle inside the box, the wiring is stressed every time you plug something in.
    Securing the device and replacing worn plates keeps everything safe, stable, and inexpensive to maintain.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Re-securing Loose Trim and Baseboards</h3>
  <p>
    Loose trim doesn’t just look bad — it creates gaps that collect dirt, insects, and moisture.
    Re-nailing or re-gluing trim protects the wall behind it and keeps your home sealed properly.
  </p>

  <h3>10. Sliding Glass Door Tune-Ups and Roller Replacement</h3>
  <p>
    Sliding glass doors take a lot of weight and daily use. Over time, the rollers flatten, dirt builds up
    in the track, and the door becomes harder and harder to open. A simple tune-up — cleaning the track,
    adjusting the door height, or replacing worn rollers — can make even the heaviest door slide like new.
    Catching it early prevents damage to the track or frame.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bottom line: small repairs are never just “small.” They’re the early warning lights of your home.
    A little attention now keeps things running smoothly and avoids the big repairs nobody wants to deal with.
